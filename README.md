Some plugins for xbar to provide some useful information about [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) in your Mac status bar. You'll need installed:
* [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) preferably installed with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* An [API token](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) for Vercel

You'll need to... (briefly, more detail to come):
* run npm install in the plugins directory
* symlink the `...bash` files into the xbar plugin directory at `~/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins`
* copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
* refresh xbar
